# 21 Savage Message Board

This is my first application using user authorization - super neat! Users have the option to login or sign-up. Eventually they are brought to a profile page where they has personalized information about their account and the option to participate in the ongoing chat feed. Each message they submit will be accompanied by their username.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Passport

## Lessons Learned:
With this project we had multiple .ejs files to navigate through so we really got the chance to pull from the database in more complex ways.

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Usage

1. run `node server.js`
2. Navigate to `localhost:8080`
